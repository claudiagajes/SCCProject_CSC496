# CSC496_SCCProject
Team name: SCC Team members: Sidney Mantwill, Colleen Baksi, Claudia Gajes Project Choice: #3

Project Plan: Documentation describing the selected computing service, including network diagram and specific details on what services being installed on which VM. We plan on using XenProject to create 2 Xen VM nodes. We plan to use geni-lib tool on CloubLab to instantiate a profile. After the profile instance starts, we will SSH into the VM to create the 2 Xen VM nodes and connect them with LAN by requesting a link.
