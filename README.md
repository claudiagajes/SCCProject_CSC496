Project Plan: The goal of our project is to get a Node.js webserver to interact with a mySQL data base through docker containers and through cloudlab.

As of right now, the mySQL database has not been correctly containerized. We have commented out the code that sets up the database so that the webserver can be tested on Cloudlab. 

We hope to have everything fully automated by the third deliverable even if the mySQL database can not succesfully be containerized.
